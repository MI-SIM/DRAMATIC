Code and files for DRAMATIC model 5: <i>DM5.Laureni</i>

This is a private repository and working directory for code to analyse and extend the model developed by Laureni et al. (2017). The model describes a hybrid Moving Bed Biofilm Reactor (MBBR) for Partial Nitritation/Anammox comprising three organisms; Ammonia Oxidising Bacteria (AOB) and Nitrite Oxidising Bacteria (NOB) in the planktonic phase, and Anammox bacteria (AMX) as a biofilm. It is a batch process with filling, reaction, and decanting stages. Currently, the model only considers two biomass state variables (AOB, NOB), with AMX constant.

The repository will be made public after agreement between collaborators.
